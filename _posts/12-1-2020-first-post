Since taking this class, Skills for Computing Professionals, I thought one great way to advance my Social Presence wwas to
create a LinkedIn Account and do my best to update that. I have been able to create a few contacts and upload information 
about myself that employers may find interesting. Of course I am still working as an expoditer at WaterStreet Oyster Bar,
and will soon be promoted to server, however, when the time comes to move on towards my career field, this LinkedIn 
profile will be a great asset to my Social Presence.
