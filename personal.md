I have developed a lot of hobbies over the course of the last 10 years and I would say my main choices in relaxing would have to be drawing and game testing. I like downloading the beta versions of differnt games that are being developed and helping find any issues or bugs that may need to be resolved. I also developed some drawing skills while teaching my little sister how to draw using 3D coloring programs for designing characters as well as programs like Shapr3D for modeling.
