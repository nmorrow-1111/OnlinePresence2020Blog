   I have developed a lot of hobbies over the course of the last 10 years and I would say my main choices in relaxing would have to be drawing and game testing. I like downloading the beta versions of differnt games that are being developed and helping find any issues or bugs that may need to be resolved. I also developed some drawing skills while teaching my little sister how to draw using 3D coloring programs for designing characters as well as programs like Shapr3D for modeling.

   I've also worked on multiple teams, creating a few games of our own these last few years. While going through my computer science classes (details in "Who am I?" tab) I had the best oppurtunity to begin working with Unity Engine and C++ as well as Visual Studios, where we came up with a different take on an endless survival game called "The Delusion of Dug". Me and two other team members spent the better half of a semester working on this game in Unity. This is where it all began for me and my trip through my college experience.
