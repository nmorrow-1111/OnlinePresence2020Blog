## Who am I?

  Hello, my name is Nicholas Morrow and I am currently enrolled as a senior in Computer Sciences with a focus in Video Game Design and Development at the University of Texas A&M-Corpus Christi.

  At TAMUCC, I have taken a plethora of classes, many useful to my field and many more not so much. Nonetheless, I'm nothing if not hard working when there is something to be done. I have been in situations where some team members haven't pulled their weight and i'll be honest, some where others have carried a portion of my weight as well. That aside, it has all taught me how to be a more responsible student and more so an honest hard-worker.
  
 
  Since taking this class, Skills for Computing Professionals, I thought one great way to advance my Social Presence was to
create a LinkedIn Account and do my best to update that. I have been able to create a few contacts and upload information 
about myself that employers may find interesting. Of course I am still working as an expediter at WaterStreet Oyster Bar,
and will soon be promoted to server, however, when the time comes to move on towards my career field, this LinkedIn 
profile will be a great asset to my Social Presence.
