## Who am I?

  Hello, my name is Nicholas Morrow and I am currently enrolled as a senior in Computer Sciences with a focus in Video Game Design and Development at the University of Texas A&M-Corpus Christi.

  At TAMUCC, I have taken a plethora of classes, many useful to my field and many more not so much. Nonetheless, I'm nothing if not hard working when there is something to be done. I have been in situations where some team members haven't pulled their weight and i'll be honest, some where others have carried a portion of my weight as well. That aside, it has all taught me how to be a more responsible student and more so an honest hard-worker.
